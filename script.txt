HikeAware enables users to find, record, and photograph native wildlife and plants, and awards the user points as they collect images of all the animals and plants in their local area. Collect images of all the native wildlife, and compare with your friends! By doing this, you can contribute to citizen science, and help the local council and conservation groups manage our local ecosystems by collating data both from these sightings, as well as a wide range of sensors used to track the weather, visitor numbers, and other ecosystem health statistics. This is also fed back into the app, which can then recommend the best times to go to specific walks in order to find different animals, based both on time of day and various weather conditions.
The app also boasts a range of other functions. View local wildlife news and alerts, explore the range of different animals
