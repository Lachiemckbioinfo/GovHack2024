The Sunshine Coast is home to beautiful walks and bike tracks with a diverse range of plants and animals. A diverse range of animals and plants call these places home, and we want to help manage our local tracks and ecosystems.
HikeAware enables users to find, record, and photograph native wildlife and plants, and awards the user points as they collect images of all the animals and plants in their local area. Collect images of all the native wildlife, and compare with your friends! By doing this, you can contribute to citizen science, and help the local council and conservation groups manage our local ecosystems by collating data both from these sightings, as well as a wide range of sensors, powered by an Internet of Things, to track the weather, visitor numbers, and other ecosystem health statistics. This is also fed back into the app using machine learning, which can then recommend the best times to go to specific walks in order to find different animals, based both on time of day and various weather conditions. The app also boasts a range of other functions. View local wildlife news and alerts, explore the range of different animals, and share your photos.

The data from the app will help our local councils and conservation groups manage our tracks and wildlife. An accessible dashboard shows all the data that is collected, and allows users to explore the data, and find connections between local environmental conditions, visitor traffic, and animal sightings.
