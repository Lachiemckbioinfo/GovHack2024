# GovHack 2024 - HikeAware

## The Product
Our project had a two-pronged approach: to both aid in citizen science and local animal awareness from an app, and to help provide greater data awareness and analysis capabilities to the local council.To do so, we have created two outputs: the app [HikeAware](https://hikeaware.vercel.app/), and an associated backend data dashboard, accessible directly through the app, or via its own address. 



## Technical Specifications

### Dashboard
The HikeAware dashboard was created using the Python Plotly Dash library. It is hosted on an ARDC Nectar cloud virtual machine. It can be accessed [here](http://203.101.226.242:8050/).

## The Challenge
We have entered into the challenge [Smart infrastructure for data-driven decision making](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/smart_infrastructure_for_data_driven_decision_making).

We are utilising the following datasets:
